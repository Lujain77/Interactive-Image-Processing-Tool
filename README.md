# Interactive-Image-Processing-Tool


This project presents a user-friendly 
graphical user interface (GUI) for image processing, 
enabling users to easily apply various filters and 
techniques for digital image enhancement. Developed 
with Tkinter in Python, the GUI allows image upload and 
interactive engagement with spatial domain image 
enhancement techniques. The project emphasizes 
fundamental aspects of digital image processing, aiming 
to enhance specific image features while suppressing 
others. Users can apply techniques such as contrast 
stretching, image negation, density clipping, edge 
enhancement, and spatial filtering. The GUI also includes 
advanced functionality such as Fourier transforms, which 
provide insight in the spatial and frequency domains. 
Overall, this project serves as a practical and educational 
tool to enhance image.
